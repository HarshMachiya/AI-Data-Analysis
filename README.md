# Supply Chain Analytics Project ðŸššðŸ“Š

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how **automation + cloud databases + AI-powered analytics** can be combined to optimize supply chain performance.  

A supply chain company was facing delivery inefficiencies in **two cities**, and with the opening of a new **Walmart distribution point**, leadership wanted to identify potential **breaks in the supply chain**.  
Using an end-to-end automated data pipeline, I built a solution to ingest, clean, and analyze data â€” and track critical **KPIs** for operational decision-making.

## ðŸ”§ Workflow
1. **n8n Automation** â†’ Automated the ingestion of sales reports from email (CSV attachments).  
2. **PostgreSQL (via Supabase)** â†’ Centralized storage and real-time database connection.  
3. **Quadratic.ai** â†’ Data analysis and visualization powered by AI.

## ðŸ“Š KPIs Monitored
- **Total Order Lines**  
- **Line Fill Rate**  
- **Volume Fill Rate**  
- **Total Orders**  
- **On-Time Delivery %**  
- **In-Full Delivery %**  
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF) %**  

These KPIs help track **order fulfillment efficiency, delivery performance, and supply chain bottlenecks**.

## ðŸŒŸ Impact
- Automated data pipeline reduced manual data handling.  
- Provided **real-time supply chain performance monitoring**.  
- Helped evaluate the effect of Walmartâ€™s new location on order fulfillment.  
- Delivered insights into **delivery delays, fill rates, and OTIF performance** for strategic decisions.
